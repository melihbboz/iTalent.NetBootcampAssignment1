In object-oriented computer programming (OOP) languages, the notion of encapsulation (or OOP Encapsulation) refers to the bundling of data, 
along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit. 
Many programming languages use encapsulation frequently in the form of classes. 
A class is a program-code-template that allows developers to create an object that has both variables (data) and behaviors (functions or methods). 
A class is an example of encapsulation in computer science in that it consists of data and methods that have been bundled into a single unit.

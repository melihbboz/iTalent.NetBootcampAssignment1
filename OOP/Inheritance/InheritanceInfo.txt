To understand inheritance, we need to focus on two types of classes: Sub Class and Super Class.

Sub Class, also known as Derived Class, it is a class that inherits the property, and Super Class is also known as Base Class; 
it is a class from which properties are inherited. 
In some concerns, Sub Class is known as child class, and the superclass is known as parent class. 
So, till now, it is obvious that the subclass, i.e. child class, inherits properties from the superclass, i.e. parent class.

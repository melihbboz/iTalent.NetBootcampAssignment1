Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world. 
Abstraction is used to describe things in simple terms. 
It’s used to create a boundary between the application and the client programs.


Objects are the building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming. 
An object contains some properties and methods. We can hide them from the outer world through access modifiers. 
We can provide access only for required functions and properties to the other programs. 
This is the general procedure to implement abstraction in OOPS.
